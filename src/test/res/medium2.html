Tobias was working on it 5 hours a day while being a full time C# developer who made software for industrial CT machines. So this was a change in not only development activity and support, but how we reached out to people, how we published meeting notes, how we communicated on Twitter, and how we recruited people to get involved with the project.</p><h4 name="2d21" id="2d21" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Medium</h4><p name="3f1f" id="3f1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://medium.com/webpack" data-href="https://medium.com/webpack" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Our Medium publication</a> is the most active it’s ever been. We not only publish content ourselves about four times a month, I’m constantly looking for great articles from other people, especially people who are under-represented in our community, so we can host those articles on our publication.</p><p name="8113" id="8113" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s so important about Medium is it allows us to aggregate and really take over mind-share of quality content for Webpack. Sometimes when an open source project first comes out or starts to get hot, you’ll tend to notice random people trying to push out a bunch of cheap 5 cent articles. We try to stop this immediately. If you search for Webpack you don’t see “Webpack Bits” or “WebpackNews.com” — you get the Webpack Medium publication. We’ve monopolized the content creation.</p><p name="af48" id="af48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I recommend people trying to build their project’s image and identity create a Medium page, make it readily accessible, and prevent content being spread across multiple random authors and channels.</p><h4 name="800b" id="800b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Outreach</h4><p name="8068" id="8068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Outreach is very important to me. Maybe it’s because I’m a talky person and I like interacting with people. When I first became a maintainer, I was too terrified to make code changes. I didn’t know how it worked. So I asked myself what I could do that I could kick ass at. I essentially just got on Twitter and started spending hours a day searching “Webpack”.</p><p name="e757" id="e757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back then there were a lot of callous messages about us, and a collective mindset about how things were in the state of the project. I literally just started responding and saying, “Hey! Can I help? Can I take your feedback?” If someone was especially difficult, I’d point out it was a great opportunity for them to contribute or maybe just to raise a GitHub issue.</p><blockquote name="1a76" id="1a76" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">When I first became a maintainer, I was too terrified to make code changes, so I asked myself what I could kick ass at.</blockquote><p name="41ca" id="41ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Most of the time, people just want to be heard and listened to.

We created this to put users in control of how the project will be shaped for the future.</p><p name="1f45" id="1f45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then we have Golden Influence, which we give for each dollar a backer or sponsor contributes. It’s 100 times stronger than normal influence. This gives a stronger influence to those who have backed us, but not so strong that it outweighs the voice of the greater collective of people who use and contribute to the project.</p><h4 name="702d" id="702d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transparency</h4><p name="df81" id="df81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ever since we were able to grow the budget large enough for Tobias to work on Webpack full time, we promised we’d keep people up to date about what we’re working on. People have the ability to look behind the scenes and see the architectural challenges. We put it out on our Medium page, on <a href="https://medium.com/webpack/freelancing-log-book/home" data-href="https://medium.com/webpack/freelancing-log-book/home" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">weekly Logbooks</a>.</p><p name="8c8b" id="8c8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And of course we use Open Collective to be transparent. It’s one of our favourite choices we’ve made: every transaction, whether a sponsorship or an individual backer, is<a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack/expenses" data-href="https://opencollective.com/webpack/expenses" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> tracked publicly</a>.

It might sounds cheesy, but the greatest power you have for haters or trolls is love. A lot of times people just want to vent, but if you show them you care they’ll be happy to help. Sometimes they’re just having a bad day, or need to be pointed in the right direction.</p><figure name="e39b" id="e39b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 790px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 112.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*n9owH8rYbz5qSHa-GvECJQ.png" data-width="1192" data-height="1346" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*n9owH8rYbz5qSHa-GvECJQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*n9owH8rYbz5qSHa-GvECJQ.png"></div></figure><blockquote name="d833" id="d833" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure">The greatest power you have for haters or trolls is love.</blockquote><p name="5aa0" id="5aa0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Love is so important to us that we take it to an extreme. If there’s ever an article that drops on Reddit or Hacker News, I try to be the first one to comment and say “Hey, thank you so much, we really appreciate the support we’ve gotten from the community.” These days, most articles about Webpack have no negative comments on them, which is a pretty powerful statement for places like Reddit and Hacker News.</p><p name="6b50" id="6b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you show you really care about what the user is trying to accomplish, and empathize with their day-to-day challenges, these small steps change the culture and perception of Webpack as a whole.</p><p name="0524" id="0524" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even with trolls, we try to just say, “We’d love your help, and we’re sorry this is happening.” Most people do understand that you are human. Maybe we have an edge as grassroots projects without big companies behind them, because we can make mistakes and publish bugs and breaking changes, and as long as we’re open and helpful about it people will just say, “Yeah, it’s Webpack, it’s OK we love ‘em.”</p><p name="f49f" id="f49f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re not only reaching out to people, you’re reaching out to project managers, CEOs and CTOs, showing that you want to change the culture and the mindset.</p><h4 name="0756" id="0756" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Partnerships First</h4><p name="c2f3" id="c2f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">When it comes to funding, I’ve never talked about money first. It’s the last thing I worry about. The first thing is “What is this person’s need? What are they trying to accomplish? And how can we help with their unmet needs and challenges?”</p><p name="4e04" id="4e04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes you have to make a play, and think about long-term strategy for your project. Sustainability is really important. We need to find out why new tools are popping into existence, not to prevent them but to understand the challenges.</p><p name="cda0" id="cda0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A great example is that we found out a year ago that Web Assembly was going to be supported by all browsers, so I started speaking to some people at Chrome Dev Summit about a possible Webpack story there. I asked who the key stakeholders were, and they pointed me at someone at Mozilla. I got connected and said there could be a great story there. So we created this relationship over time, prior to even thinking about a grant.</p><p name="b5f7" id="b5f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then when we found out that Mozilla had a grant for open source projects, it was really important to me that we chose the right thing to work on, because Web Assembly was a killer feature for Firefox and there are huge incentives behind it. That meant the likelihood of success of the grant was a lot higher if we submitted it to Mozilla.</p><p name="a305" id="a305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Those are the strategies that are really important to think about long-term. For what it’s worth, every feature we work on has to be beneficial to the web ecosystem and to users — it’s not like you can just find a company that needs something landed and say, “Hey let’s do it.” You have to be forward thinking and have an idea of what your long-term roadmap is.</p></div></div></section><section name="63ad" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="b276" id="b276" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Q&amp;A</h3><h4 name="6a81" id="6a81" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Q. What’s your advice for projects just getting started with funding, and those who have made a start but want to take it to the next level?</h4><p name="f52e" id="f52e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If you’ve never funded your project before, the first thing to do is understand what you’re planning to do with the funding. If you had $20,000 what would you do with it?</p><p name="3854" id="3854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We believe that anyone who wants to work on open source should be supported. Whether it’s 20 hours or 40 hours, we don’t think they should have to find a job that supports open source. We should help them to work on the project and then expense the work they’ve done. I wanted to fund Tobias because he not only loved working on the project, but he needed to sustain himself day to day. I was in a situation where I had a stable job, but I wanted to be able to put in the time and justify it. And I want that for anybody.</p><blockquote name="eb7b" id="eb7b" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">If you’ve never funded your project before, the first thing to do is understand what you’re planning to do with the funding.</blockquote><p name="921c" id="921c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">So, if not a roadmap, at least have an outline of what you want. Why are you raising money? What specifically are you going to fund? Is it time, infrastructure, hosting on Travis with extra parallelism, events, speakers, meetups? There are so many different things, so focus on two or three. Identify your needs so you can forecast your budget.</p><p name="5b09" id="5b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For projects that have some money and want to increase it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel" data-href="https://opencollective.com/babel" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Babel</a> is always the project that jumps to my mind. Henry has done an incredible job with the community side and wrangling contributors, but this is where “partnerships first” comes in.</p><p name="3f31" id="3f31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve got some initial funding you need to get out there and meet people. Find companies or developers who are using your tool and ask, “Hey, what are you biggest challenges?” Then over time, when you’ve strengthened the bond with this person by helping them, start talking about collaborating on potential features that could benefit everyone. Just build up the connection with the person and their organisation.</p><blockquote name="6e31" id="6e31" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s not charity, it’s value in return.”</blockquote><p name="7f60" id="7f60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Eventually, you’ll be able to point out an awesome sponsorship opportunity or invite them to become an official sponsor to get better publicity. Share with people that they love your tool and they support open source. It could be great marketing. It’s not charity, it’s value in return, even if it’s not something you can immediately expense.</p><p name="2bd3" id="2bd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starting with partnerships is the most important thing. With Trivago, we’d been communicating with them for two years. Initially they had Tobias go out there and showed him their workflow and their environment. They were looking to hire someone full time to maintain these things.

Something I always try to nip in the bud immediately is people saying, “You should be funding this project more” or “Why aren’t you charging a license for this?” Because anytime you start focusing on the money first, you’re always going to lose out. It’s more important to have positive, inspiring sentiments, and they are much more valuable than monetary figures. If people tweet complaints, I say “Please stop. We are super happy with what we have.”</p><p name="c9ea" id="c9ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s never about the money first, and we honestly believe that.

I started talking with them at a conference in Copenhagen and said “Hey, you’re trying to build your enterprise and we have lots of hits on our documentation. Instead of spending $20,000 to sponsor one conference, you could spend the same for millions of impressions by being on our docs page.” They tell me they get 50–100 clickthroughs daily.
